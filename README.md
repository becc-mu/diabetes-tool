## The Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool
 The diabetes assessment tool will ask users four questions in order to ascertain their risk level for developing diabetes. Each question will have four possible answers (e.g. they are multiple-choice questions). Each answer will carry a numerical value, the total of which will be used to determine an individualâ€™s risk level. Questions, answers and numerical values are detailed in table 1 below.
